8/26/23, 9:28 AM - Jãtîñ: @919416270238 Good Morning Mam , Today's event was great but it was not well organised and result was also not fair. The winner of 1st and 2nd position of TIT&S College Boys used unfair means to secure the position and the third runner up is not a student of our college. Despite these discrepancies the organisers declared the result of marathon. This is injustice to genuine participants who deserve to win. Please acknowledge this matter and do the needful. Thank you!
